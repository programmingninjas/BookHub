![logo](https://github.com/programmingninjas/BookHub/blob/main/static/bookhub.png)

* BookHub is the one stop destination for you to download eBooks. Made with flask and love

* Currently this project supports Amazon and Flipkart links but accuracy is 80%. You can simply write book name too :)

* Since this project uses web scrapping if you get NoneType error this usually indicates that class of tags from which it is extracting book title has been changed.

## Installation

* Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running Flask server
```
python run.py
```
## To run website  _open browser_
```
localhost:5000
```
