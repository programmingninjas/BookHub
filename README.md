BookHub is the one stop destination for you to download eBooks. Made with flask and love

Currently this project supports Amazon and Flipkart links but their accuracy is 80%. You can simply write book name too :).

Since this project uses web scrapping if you get NoneType error this usually indicates that class of tags from which it is extracting book title has been changed. 

⚠️ Don't forget to pip install all the libraries required and also libgen_api
