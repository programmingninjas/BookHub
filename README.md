* BookHub is the one stop destination for you to download eBooks. Made with flask and love

* Currently this project supports Amazon and Flipkart links but accuracy is 80%. You can simply write book name too :)

* Since this project uses web scrapping if you get NoneType error this usually indicates that class of tags from which it is extracting book title has been changed.
